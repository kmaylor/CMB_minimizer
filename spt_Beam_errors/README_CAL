This file contains calibration information for the three SPT-SZ bands.
The calibrations in this file are only appropriate for use with the 
rev3.2 beams (spt.uchicago.edu:/data/sptdat/beams/rev3.2).

The procedure for obtaining these numbers is described on the wiki
page https://spt.uchicago.edu/trac/wiki/planck_cal_all. The short 
version is: this is a bandpower-based comparison between the 
2500 deg^2 SPT bandpowers and the full-sky Planck bandpowers.

The best-fit calibrations (i.e., the number by which the out-of-the-box,
rcw38-calibrated maps should be multiplied to make them agree with Planck)
for the three bands are:

95 GHz: multiply map by 0.703
150 GHz: multiply map by 0.813
220 GHz: multiply map by 0.713

The single-band fractional uncertainties (square root of the diagonal
elements of the band-band calibration covariance matrix divided by 
best-fit calibration) are:

95 GHz: 0.65%
150 GHz: 0.63% 
220 GHz: 1.21%

Note that these uncertainties are in TEMPERATURE, not power.

The full fractional covariance matrix is:

 4.244e-05  3.844e-05  3.844e-05
 3.844e-05  3.965e-05  3.844e-05
 3.844e-05  3.844e-05  1.466e-04
